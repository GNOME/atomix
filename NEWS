2005-09-12: Released version 1.2.3

	* Fixes some bugs
	* Brings up-to-date documentation
	* Integrates better with the environment, mainly by making more
	  use of GTK+ stock icons and the new default GtkAbout

2005-06-26: Released version 1.2.2

	* Build and installation improvements
	* Better desktop integration through the .desktop file
	* Usability improvements, by disabling menu items at times they
	  cannot be used

2005-06-17: Released version 1.2.1

	* Builds with GCC 4.0.
	* Doesn't require libglade to build.
	* Provides an icon, both for the window and the menu.
	* Greatly improved internationalization, by allowing the translation
	  of molecule names.
	* Tries not to silently ignore the user when no action can be taken
	  (e.g. viewing scores when no scores were achieved).
	* Changes commercial namings of molecules to their original (correct?)
	  names, such as Formaldehyd being renamed to Methanal.
	* Finally moved to the new level file format, instead of converting
	  old formats at build-time. That also means level-convert is likely
	  to die pretty soon.

	* New maintainer (Atomix is now developed by another person)
	* Fixes the bug that made all the translations available be displayed
	  on the main application menu at the same time, making the game pretty
	  unusable for non-English speakers.
	* Doesn't force the existance of an .atomix directory in the users'
	  home directories, although it will still work if the users want
	  and have one.
	* General code improvements.

2003-12-03: Released version 1.0
	
	  * Build fixes (Gtk+ & ranlib)
