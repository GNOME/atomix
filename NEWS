	* Better desktop integration through the .desktop file

	* Builds with GCC 4.0.
	* Doesn't require libglade to build.
	* Provides an icon, both for the window and the menu.
	* Greatly improved internationalization, by allowing the translation
	  of molecule names.
	* Tries not to silently ignore the user when no action can be taken
	  (e.g. viewing scores when no scores were achieved).
	* Changes commercial namings of molecules to their original (correct?)
	  names, such as Formaldehyd being renamed to Methanal.
	* Finally moved to the new level file format, instead of converting
	  old formats at build-time. That also means level-convert is likely

	* New maintainer (Atomix is now developed by another person)

	  unusable for non-English speakers.
	* Doesn't force the existance of an .atomix directory in the users'
	  home directories, although it will still work if the users want
	  and have one.
	* General code improvements.
