Atomix is a puzzle mind game where you have to build molecules out of single 
atoms. These are laying around between the walls and obstacles on the 
playfield. Once you have pushed an atom in one direction it moves until it hits 
an obstacle or another atom. It needs some thinking how to construct complex 
molecules with this atom behaviour. The game is inspired by the original Amiga
version. It uses the Gnome libraries and is distributed under the terms of
the General Public License (GPL).

To be able to compile this package you need at least the alpha release of the 
GNOME 2.0 base libraries installed. For compilation and installation of this
package see the generic installation notes in the INSTALL file.
