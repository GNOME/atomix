Atomix is a puzzle game in which you have to build full molecules, from simple
inorganic ones in the first levels to extremely complex organic ones in the
last levels, out of isolated atoms, which are laying around among walls and
other obstacles on the playfield.

Once you push an atom in a certain direction, it will move until it hits
something that makes it stop, which could be a wall or another atom. This
behaviour is exactly what makes playing it not trivial and, therefore, fun,
as you need to think quite a lot about how to have your molecule organized.

For compilation and installation instructions, see the notes in the INSTALL
file. As for latest releases, they are always available on the GNOME official
FTP site:

If you find any bugs or have any kind of feature requests, please, let me know
by reporting them on the GNOME bugzilla, either by using bug-buddy or by 
visiting http://bugzilla.gnome.org.
